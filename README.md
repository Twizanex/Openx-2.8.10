"Do not reinvent the wheel"- Why use Openx ad server also called Revive Adserver instead of just using Elgg engine stand alone plugin to Serve and manange ads?  If you are asking yourself this question, you’re not alone. ... You know you don't want to reinvent the wheels because you might end up with flat tires and huge amount of time of debuging the codes ... Personally; I would recommend serious programmer to use the tools that work and incorporate them with the existing tools like Elgg engine.
